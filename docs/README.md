# Dock documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Dock documentation. This page is the entry point for the
documentation site and collects links to guides, reference topics and other
resources. These articles explain how to use the Dock layout system from basic
setup through advanced customization. The examples assume an Avalonia
application created with the .NET SDK. For build instructions and an overview of the repository see the [project README](../README.md). If you are new to Dock, start with the guides under *Get started*.
