# Dock Documentation

Welcome to the Dock documentation.  The files in this folder describe how to
use the Dock layout system from simple getting started examples to
advanced customization scenarios.  The documents assume you have an
Avalonia application created with the .NET SDK.  If you are new to Dock
start with the MVVM guide and work your way towards the deep dive. If you
just want to see Dock running quickly, check out the Quick Start below.
