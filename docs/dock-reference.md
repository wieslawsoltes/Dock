# Dock API Reference

This reference summarizes the most commonly used classes in Dock. It is based on the samples found in the repository and the public APIs in the `Dock.Model` packages. The MVVM, ReactiveUI and XAML approaches share the same underlying types so the following sections apply to all three.

## Core interfaces

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IDockable` | Base interface for items that can be shown in a dock. Provides `Id`, `Title`, `Context`, optional size limits and lifecycle methods like `OnClose`. |
| `IDock` | Extends `IDockable` with collections of visible dockables and commands such as `GoBack`, `GoForward`, `Navigate` or `Close`. The `CanCloseLastDockable` flag controls whether the final item may be closed. |
| `IRootDock` | The top level container. In addition to the `IDock` members it exposes pinned dock collections and commands to manage windows. |
| `IProportionalDock` | A dock that lays out its children horizontally or vertically using a `Proportion` value. |
| `IStackDock` | Dock based on `StackPanel` with `Orientation` and `Spacing`. |
| `IGridDock` | Dock using `Grid` layout via `ColumnDefinitions` and `RowDefinitions`. |
| `IWrapDock` | Dock built on `WrapPanel` exposing `Orientation`. |
| `IUniformGridDock` | Dock that arranges items in equally sized cells using `Rows` and `Columns`. |
| `IToolDock` / `IDocumentDock` | Specialized docks used for tools and documents. |
| `ITool` | Represents a tool pane. Tools can specify `MinWidth`, `MaxWidth`, `MinHeight` and `MaxHeight` to control their size. |
| `IProportionalDockSplitter` | Thin splitter placed between proportional docks. Exposes `CanResize` to enable or disable dragging. |
| `IGridDockSplitter` | Splitter for `IGridDock` controlling the resize direction. |
| `IDockWindow` / `IHostWindow` | Interfaces representing floating windows created when dockables are detached. |

## Tracking bounds and pointer positions

`IDockable` includes a set of methods used by the docking logic to remember the
position of a dockable and the pointer during drag operations. These methods are
implemented by `DockableBase` which stores the values in a `TrackingAdapter`.
The adapter starts with `NaN` coordinates until a value is set.

- `GetVisibleBounds(out x, out y, out width, out height)` and
  `SetVisibleBounds(x, y, width, height)` return or store the last known bounds
  of the dockable while it is visible in a dock. `OnVisibleBoundsChanged` is
  invoked whenever the values are updated.
- `GetPinnedBounds`/`SetPinnedBounds`/`OnPinnedBoundsChanged` track the
  dimensions used when a tool is pinned to one of the layout edges.
- `GetTabBounds`/`SetTabBounds`/`OnTabBoundsChanged` hold the bounds of a
  dockable displayed as a tab inside another dock.
- `GetPointerPosition`/`SetPointerPosition`/`OnPointerPositionChanged` store the
  pointer coordinates relative to the dock control.
- `GetPointerScreenPosition`/`SetPointerScreenPosition`/
  `OnPointerScreenPositionChanged` do the same using screen coordinates.

These values are consulted when calculating drop targets or restoring a layout
from a saved state.

## Document dock options

`IDocumentDock` exposes two key properties for controlling its tab strip. `EnableWindowDrag` allows the entire window to be dragged via the tab area. `TabsLayout` chooses where the tabs appear using the `DocumentTabLayout` enum.

The factory provides helper methods `SetDocumentDockTabsLayoutLeft`, `SetDocumentDockTabsLayoutTop` and `SetDocumentDockTabsLayoutRight` to change the layout at runtime.

To create new documents programmatically, set the `DocumentFactory`
delegate. The `CreateDocument` command invokes this factory and then
adds the returned document via `AddDocument`.

## Host window options

`HostWindow` exposes `IsToolWindow`, `ToolChromeControlsWholeWindow` and
`DocumentChromeControlsWholeWindow`. These properties toggle pseudo classes on
the window so styles can react to different chrome configurations.

## Factory API

The `IFactory` interface (implemented by `Factory` in `Dock.Model.Mvvm` and `Dock.Model.ReactiveUI`) contains numerous helpers used by the samples to build and manipulate layouts. Important members include:

- Methods such as `CreateRootDock`, `CreateProportionalDock`, `CreateToolDock` and `CreateDocumentDock` used when constructing the initial layout.
- `CreateLayout()` which returns an `IRootDock` ready to display.
- `InitLayout`, `InitDockable` and `InitDockWindow` for wiring up newly created objects.
- Runtime operations like `AddDockable`, `InsertDockable`, `MoveDockable`, `SwapDockable`, `PinDockable`, `FloatDockable` and the various `Close*` methods.
- Helpers on `DocumentDock` like `AddDocument` and on `ToolDock` like `AddTool` to insert and activate dockables programmatically.
- Events (found in `IFactory.Events`) that signal changes to the layout such as `DockableAdded`, `DockableRemoved`, `WindowOpened` and many more.

A minimal example of creating a layout manually:

```csharp
var factory = new DockFactory();
var root = factory.CreateRootDock();
var docDock = factory.CreateDocumentDock();
root.VisibleDockables = factory.CreateList<IDockable>(docDock);
factory.InitLayout(root);
```

Refer to the factory classes under `samples/DockMvvmSample` and `samples/DockReactiveUISample` for practical examples of these methods in use.

## Using the MVVM library

`Dock.Model.Mvvm` provides base classes that implement property change notification via `INotifyPropertyChanged`. Create a custom `Factory` derived from `Dock.Model.Mvvm.Factory` and override `CreateLayout` to build your docks. View models should derive from the MVVM versions of `Dockable`, `Tool` and `Document`.

The MVVM sample demonstrates how to subscribe to factory events and update the UI through commands.

## Using the ReactiveUI library

`Dock.Model.ReactiveUI` exposes the same API surface as the MVVM version but replaces the implementation with ReactiveUI types. Commands are typically created using `ReactiveCommand` and properties use `ReactiveObject` helpers. The layout and event handling is otherwise identical to the MVVM approach.

## Declaring layouts in XAML

The XAML sample shows that a layout can be declared entirely in markup using `DockControl` and the various dock types. The `Dock.Serializer` package can persist these layouts to disk. In XAML you place `RootDock`, `ProportionalDock`, `ToolDock` or `DocumentDock` elements inside a `DockControl`, optionally providing a factory for runtime behaviour. A binary implementation named `ProtobufDockSerializer` is available from the `Dock.Serializer.Protobuf` package.

`DockSerializer` from the same package can save or load layouts as JSON. The
samples register an instance of this serializer through dependency injection so
commands can call `SaveAsync` and `LoadAsync` to persist user changes.
