# Floating Windows

Dock can detach dockables into separate floating windows. These windows are represented by the `IDockWindow` interface and hosted using `IHostWindow` implementations.

## Creating windows

`FactoryBase` exposes a `CreateWindowFrom` method which returns an `IHostWindow`. Override this method on your factory to customize the platform window used for floating docks:

```csharp
public override IHostWindow CreateWindowFrom(IDockWindow source)
{
    var window = base.CreateWindowFrom(source);
    window.Title = $"Dock - {source.Id}";
    return window;
}
```

Calling `FloatDockable` on the factory opens a dockable in a new window. The returned `IDockWindow` stores its bounds and title and can be serialized together with the layout.

## Choosing the starting dock

Dockables may declare a preferred side when they are first shown. Assign one of the
`DockMode` values to the `Dock` property on your view model to request docking on the
left, right, top, bottom or center. When a window is docked without an explicit
operation this value guides the placement. Tools further refine the position of auto
hide panels through the `Alignment` property on their containing `ToolDock`.

## Window chrome options

`HostWindow` provides two boolean properties that control how its chrome behaves:

- `ToolChromeControlsWholeWindow`
- `DocumentChromeControlsWholeWindow`

When enabled these toggle the `:toolchromecontrolswindow` or
`:documentchromecontrolswindow` pseudo class respectively. Styles can use these
states to remove the standard system chrome and let the Dock chrome occupy the
entire window.

## Presenting and closing

`IDockWindow` exposes `Present(bool isDialog)` to show the window and `Exit()` to close it programmatically. The default implementation uses `HostAdapter` to bridge between the interface and the underlying Avalonia `Window`.

Use the `WindowOpened` and `WindowClosed` events on the factory to track when floating windows appear or disappear.

```csharp
factory.WindowClosed += (_, e) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"Closed {e.Window?.Title}");
```
