# MultiWindowSample

This sample demonstrates how to open multiple topâ€‘level windows using Dock. It follows the steps from the complex layouts guide to float dockables into separate windows and persist the resulting layout.

Run the application with:

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/MultiWindowSample
```

On first start the sample creates two windows. Moving or closing them then exiting writes `layout.json`. The file is loaded on the next run so the previous window arrangement reappears.
