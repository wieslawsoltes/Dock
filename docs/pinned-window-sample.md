# Pinned window sample

The `PinnedWindowSample` project demonstrates autoâ€‘hidden tools shown in a floating window.
`DockSettings.UsePinnedDockWindow` is enabled in `Program.cs` so pinned docks render
inside a transparent overlay window that follows the main layout.

When running the sample the left and bottom tools start pinned. Hover over the
corresponding grip to preview the tool. Use the pin command from the chrome menu
to unpin or pin the tools again. The preview window closes automatically when
the tool is hidden.

Build and launch the project from the repository root:

```bash
cd samples/PinnedWindowSample
dotnet run
```
